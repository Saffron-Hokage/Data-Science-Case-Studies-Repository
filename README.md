# Data Science and Machine Learning Case Studies

Welcome to my repository for practicing various data science concepts and machine learning algorithms through case studies! This repository contains a collection of projects aimed at sharpening my skills in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and predictive analytics.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a variety of case studies covering different domains, datasets, and techniques commonly used in the field of data science and machine learning. Each case study is designed to provide hands-on experience in:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and evaluation
- Deployment and inference (where applicable)


## Case Studies

### [Case Study 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](link_to_case_study_1)

Description: This project focuses on predicting housing prices using a dataset containing various features such as location, size, and amenities.

### [Case Study 2: K Means Clustering](link_to_case_study_2)

Description: In this case study, we explore customer churn prediction using a telecom dataset, aiming to identify factors influencing customer retention.

### [Case Study 3: Logistic_Regression](link_to_case_study_3)

Description: This project involves sentiment analysis on social media data to classify user sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

### [Case Study 4: Multi Linear Regression](link_to_case_study_3)

Description: This project involves sentiment analysis on social media data to classify user sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Getting Started
